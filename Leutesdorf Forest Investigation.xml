<!--RWWS/hb. 
26 November 1947-->
         <p>An "on the spot" investigation of <placeName><geogName>LEUTESDORF FOREST</geogName></placeName> revealed the wreckage of a B-I7 SN.43-38189, nicknamed "Powerful Katinka." Missing Air Crew Heport #K-484 shows nine (9) members of the crew in plane at the time of crash, four (4) returned to Military Control, five (5) on a PDD Status. Inclosed for reference are two Missing Air Crew Reports (#K-484 Exhibit "A" and #R-348 Exhibit "B").</p>
         <p><persName>DRUGAN, DONALD T.</persName>, 2nd It., 0-768485. Burial Report shows Lt. DHUGAN ss being disinterred with two (2) I.D. tags from BEROD (K-5L/wP-9727), Germany end coming from plane, identified by two machine gun numbers 647650 and 647764 (MACR # H-348), of which Lt. DRUGAN was not a member. This B-IT7 SN. 42-31582 is believed to have crashed in the vicinity of BEROD, Germany.</p>
         <p><persName>MOHN, JONATHAN V.</persName>, 2nd Lt., 0-775481. Burial Report shows <persName>Lt. MOHN</persName> disinterred from Leutesdorf Forest (K-51/F-7506), Germany as a surface burial, identified by two (2)I.D. tags. No. K-484 <persName>Lt. MOHN</persName> is listed as Co-pilot.</p>

         <p>and removed the I.D. tag. The remains were interred in Leutesdorf Cemetery and since
            disinterred by an unknown American Unit Mr. Walsdorf gave the I.D. tag to the
            Undersigned. All the people that had anything to do with handling the remains were
            questioned in an attempt to definitely establish the grave WASSERMANN was buried in
            Leutesdorf Cemetery so final identification could be made, but nothing could be
            obtained.</p>
         <p>PARKER, JURL T., Sgt. 38469636. Records of this Headquarters show Sgt. PARKER
            disinterred as Unknown X-2278, later identified. X-2278 was disinterred from BEROD,
            (K-5I/xF-9727), Germany. On the back of the burial report Sgt. Parker came from the B-I7
            with machine gun numbers 647650 and 647764 which is not the plane Sgt. PARKER was in</p>
         <p>STEVENS, ROBERT, Sgt., 39719976. There is no record of Sgt. Stevens being re-interred as
            a known. Forester WALBDORF was present at the time the remains were located and interred
            in LEUTESDORF Cemetery end since disinterred by an unknown American Unit. (Exhibit
            "D").From the above information it appears the remains from the two planes were mixed up
            after disinterment. A total of fifteen (15) remains were disinterred from LEUTESDORF
            Cemetery and adjacent woods, fourteen (14) from the cemetery and one (I) from the woods
            (Lt. MOHN). Of the fifteen (15) deceased five (5) described above were from B-I7
            reported on MACR #K-484, and ten (10) were from B-I7 reported on MACR #V-43. (Exhibit
            “E”).</p>
         <!--Narrative on Investigation of Cases in the Leutesdorf Forest. dtd. 26 November 1947, cont'd.)-->
         <p>With reference to Begic Communications, Cese Numbers (Germany K-5I) 9786 and 9808,
            pertaining to several American graves in the FOREST OF LEUTESDORF, negative results were
            obtained. Mr. KROHN was contacted and his information came from several other people,
            primarily Mr. LINZ and Mr. ULMERSBACH.</p>
         <pb n="3" /><label n="263"></label><label><stamp>ITS 026</stamp></label>
         <p>Mr. LINZ was contacted with reference to inclosures signed by SS Troops, he has a very
            revengeful attitude and has the tendency to exaggerate.Ur. ULMEHSBACH wes also contacted
            end his attitude is much the same as Mr. LINZ, because the Americans upon taking
            Leutesdorf put him in as Burgermeister, later the German people through the French had
            him thrown out. The French War Crimes Commission at Koblenz worked with the undersigned
            and carried out an investigation of their own, resulting in Mr. GROMIG'S arrest and
            eventual trial. Inclosed as Exhibit "F" is the capy of the French investigation.</p>
         <p>The undersigned obtained statements from the following people:</p>
         <!--Exhibit "G" Statement of Mr. LINZ  
            Exhibit "H" Statement of the boy SCHUIZ who originally was too young to legally sign his name, but signed the statement later upon the request of the undersigned. 
            Exhibit "I" & “J" Statement of Nr. GROMIG 
            Exhibit "K" Statement of Mr. WALSDOHF 
            Exhibit "L" Statement of Mr. GLUSING -->
         <p>Included in the French Investigation("Exhibit "F") are statements from Mr. GLUSING, Mrs.
            ZEUS, Mis BARKLAGE, Mr. GROMIG, Mr. ZEUS, Mr. WIMBRSBACH, Mr. LINZ and Mr. WALSDORF.
            Additional information was obtained from Mr. SCHNEIDER (Exhibit "M") and Mr. GLUSING
            (Exhibit "N"). A sketch is attached as exhibit "O". Following is a summary of the
            information obtained: A four (4) motored Bomber supposedly crashed in the vicinity of
            LEUTESDORF. Several planes crashed in this area and have been located, identified and
            crews accounted for. The Bomber in question can not be located, identified, or any
            members of its crew identified. At the time of the crash which took place about
            September or October 1944, one (I) crew-member lived in the IEUTESDCRF Woods for three
            (3) or four (4) weeks. During this time he made and lived in two huts (2), located</p>
         <pb n="4" /><label n="264"></label><label><stamp>ITS 027</stamp></label>
         <p>as shown on Exhibit "O" at points B and C. In the month of October 1944, the forester
            WALSDORF found this airmen at point C. took him to a farm (Point D), where he talked to
            two French POWs and ate a meal. (Exhibits "P" end ""). From one POW a description of the
            airmen was obtained : Forty (40) years to forty-five years old, radio operator from a
            four (4) motored Bomber with a crew of mostly negros, height about one (I) meter and
            seventy-five (75) cm, heavily built, about eighty (80) kgs, black heir, dark skin, small
            eyes, married to an Americen nurse stationed in Paris and had two children.</p>
         <p>From point D the airmen was taken to the Burgermeister's OFFICE in LEUTESDORF,
            registered (Records have since been lost), And evacuated at Neuwied. One or two days
            later, the prisoner was returned to LEUTESDORF, in the company of a member ef the
            GESTAPO named EICH (EICH wes killed toward the end of the war by German soldiers,) and a
            member of the French Legion. From the Burgermeister's Office they proceeded to
            HUBERTUSHOF with GROMIG. At HUBERTUSHOF the Forester wes not there to show the way into
            the woods, so a boy named SCHUTZ proceeded to direct the group, which by this time had
            increased in number to five (5). From HUBEKRTUSHOF they followed the route indicated by
            a red pencil on the sketch Exhibit "I".</p>
         <p>From this point on there are several stories, but this is what the undersigned believed
            happened:</p>
         <p>The group of five (5) proceeded to a point in the woods, indicated at Point E, where Mr.
            GROMIG told the boy SCHUTZ to return. The boy departed in the direction indicated by a
            blue pencil and returned to LEUTESDORF. For the first 100 hundred yards after the boy
            departed, he looked back and watched the remaining four (4) enter the woods at Point F.
            Information as to what happened from there on is very vague. It is further believed,
            however, GRONIG, EICH, the French Legionnaire and the airmen proceeded into the woods
            and the airmen shot at a point unknown. Since EICH is dead, the French Legionnaire is
            Unknown and GROMIG will not talk, it is very difficult to locate the place of murder.
            The party without the airman returned to LEUTESDORF, where various converstions</p>
         <pb n="5" /><label n="265"></label><label><stamp>ITS 028</stamp></label>
         <p>were held and remarks made. The LEUTESDORF woods have been thoroughly searched along the
            routes followed and at Points B,E,F and C with negative results as to locating the
            grave. It is believed at this time as every possible clue has been followed up and no
            further information is available. </p>
         <p>Another grave referred to in the basic communication was reported by Mr. SHNEIDER. While
            walking in the woods one day with his two boys in May 1944, SCHNEIDER found a body.
            (Exhibits "G" and "M”). The undersigned took Mr.SCHNEIDER into the woods to have him
            point out the spot where he had seen the body, indicated on the sketch at Point A. After
            searching the ground in the vicinity of Point A, a soft spot was found and the remains
            of a body were discovered. The deceased was clothed, as Mr. Schneider stated, as follows
            : Civilian Clothes and parts of a French uniform, French shoes, French aspirin tube in
            the pocket. The head was in several pieces end a piece of denture was found, part of a
            plate from a full set of false teeth. Printed on the rubber part of the plate was
            MEUNIER BURDIN PATENT NO. 00. From all appearances the remains are not American or
            English, but are French.</p>
         <p>In Exhibit “C" the statement GLUSING made, according to LINZ, was "keep mum about this,
            it was not only one (I) but three (3), they were spies", is a false statement made by
            LINZ to implicate more people. Another Letter from LINZ mentioned in basic communication
            refers to a wounded pilot. All of the information LINZ has written is second or third
            handaend exaggerated. The wounded pilot was taken to a hospital and has been returned to
            the Z.I. His name was SMITH Paul E., PFC. 13155431, reported on MARC #K-503. Exhibit
            "R". Two (2) other remains referred to by Mr. LINZ have been disinterred and reburied in
            HAMM, Military Cemetery. They are: CHINCHILLA, FRANCIS P. and HOLLENBECK, CHARLES E.
            (Exhibit "R") who were murdered and buried in WOLLENDORF. Since disinterment, persons
            concerned with the atrocity have been tried and punished.</p>

         <p>With reference to letter from Office of Military Government, Liaison and Security
            Office, SK, LK, Offenbach (Hessen) APO 633, US.Army, signed by Arthur SHANLY, 1st LT.,
            Mr. LINZ is not working for the French Military Government. The reason the French told
            him to keep quiet is because LINZ has been living in this vicinity which has been about
            all his life. He has been arrested fourteen (14) times for stirring up trouble. Mr. LINZ
            can only refer to other people as he has no first hand information.It has been rumored
            by Linz thét Frau ZEUS gave the French wine to have Mr. ZEUS released from jail. This
            rumor is also false. The French buy wine from all the wine merchants in the French Zone.
            The French War Crimes Commission in Koblenz and the French Military Government in
            Koblenz and NEUWIED have been working in conjunction with the undersigned and have been
            of great help and assistance. </p>
         <!--CONCLUSION : -->
         <p>That all the deceased mentioned in the Basic Communications (Germany K-5I) 9786 and 9808
            have been recovered except of one (I) unknown airmen, murdered in the LEUTESDORF FOREST.
            All possible efforts have been exhausted with negative results as to the location of an
            American grave.</p>
