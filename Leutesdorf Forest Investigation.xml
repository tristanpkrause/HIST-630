DRUGAN</persName> was not a member. This B-IT7 SN. 42-31582 is believed to have crashed in the vicinity of <placeName><settlement type="village">BEROD</settlement></placeName>, Germany.</p>
         <p><persName>MOHN, JONATHAN V.</persName>, 2nd Lt., 0-775481. Burial Report shows <persName>Lt.

         <p>and removed the I.D. tag. The remains were interred in <placeName><settlement type="village">Leutesdorf Cemetery</settlement></placeName> and since disinterred by an unknown <placeName><country type="nation"><placeName><country type="nation">American</country></placeName></country></placeName> Unit. Mr. <persName><persName>WALSDORF</persName></persName> gave the I.D. tag to the <!--Undersigned-->. All the people that had anything to do with handling the remains were questioned in an attempt to definitely establish the grave <persName>WASSERMANN</persName> was buried in <placeName><settlement type="village">Leutesdorf </settlement></placeName> Cemetery so final identification could be made, but nothing could be obtained.</p>
         <p><persName>PARKER, JURL T.</persName>, Sgt. 38469636. Records of this Headquarters show <persName>Sgt. PARKER</persName>disinterred as Unknown X-2278, later identified. X-2278 was disinterred from <placeName><settlement type="village">BEROD</settlement></placeName>,(K-5I/xF-9727), Germany. On the back of the burial report Sgt.

            <p><persName>STEVENS, ROBERT</persName>, Sgt., 39719976. There is no record of Sgt.<persName>Stevens</persName> being re-interred as a known. Forester <persName>WALBDORF</persName> was present at the time the remains were located and interred in <placeName><settlement type="village">LEUTESDORF</settlement></placeName> Cemetery and since disinterred by an unknown <placeName><country type="nation">American</country></placeName> Unit. (Exhibit "D").From the above information it appears the remains from the two planes were mixed up after disinterment. A total of fifteen (15) remains were disinterred from <placeName><settlement type="village">LEUTESDORF</settlement></placeName> Cemetery and adjacent woods, fourteen (14) from the cemetery and one (I) from the woods <persName>(Lt.

         <p>With reference to Begic Communications, Cese Numbers (Germany K-5I) 9786 and 9808, pertaining to several <placeName><country type="nation">American</country></placeName> graves in the <placeName><geogName>FOREST OF LEUTESDORF</geogName></placeName>, negative results were obtained. Mr. <persName>KROHN</persName> was contacted and his information came from several other people, primarily Mr. <persName>LINZ</persName> and Mr. <persName><persName>ULMERSBACH</persName></persName>.</p>
         <pb n="3" /><label n="263"></label><label><stamp>ITS 026</stamp></label>
         <p>Mr. <persName>LINZ</persName> was contacted with reference to inclosures signed by SS Troops, he has a very revengeful attitude and has the tendency to exaggerate.Ur. <persName>ULMERSBACH</persName> wes also contacted end his attitude is much the same as Mr. <persName>LINZ</persName>, because the <placeName><country type="nation">American</country></placeName>s upon taking <placeName><settlement type="village">Leutesdorf</settlement></placeName> put him in as Burgermeister, later the <placeName><country type="nation">German</country></placeName> people through the <placeName><country type="nation">French</country></placeName> had him thrown out. The <placeName><country type="nation">French</country></placeName> War Crimes Commission at <placeName><settlement type="town">KOBLENZ</settlement></placeName> worked with the undersigned and carried out an investigation of their own, resulting in Mr. <persName>GROMIG's</persName> arrest and eventual trial. Inclosed as Exhibit "F" is the capy of the <placeName><country type="nation">French</country></placeName> investigation.</p>

            <item>Exhibit "L" Statement of Mr. <persName>GLUSING</persName></item></list></div>
            <div type="report">
          <p>Included in the <placeName><country type="nation">French</country></placeName> Investigation("Exhibit "F") are statements from Mr. <persName>GLUSING</persName>, Mrs. <persName>ZEUS</persName>, Mis <persName>BARKLAGE</persName>, Mr. <persName>GROMIG</persName>, Mr. <persName>ZEUS</persName>, Mr. <persName>WIMBRSBACH</persName>, Mr. <persName>LINZ</persName> and Mr. <persName>WALSDORF</persName>. Additional information was obtained from Mr. <persName>SCHNEIDER</persName> (Exhibit "M") and Mr. <persName>GLUSING</persName> (Exhibit "N"). A sketch is attached as exhibit "O". Following is a summary of the information obtained: A four (4) motored Bomber supposedly crashed in the vicinity of <placeName><settlement type="village">LEUTESDORF</settlement></placeName>. Several planes crashed in this area and have been located, identified and crews accounted for. The Bomber in question can not be located, identified, or any members of its crew identified. At the time of the crash which took place about September or October 1944, one (I) crew-member lived in the <placeName><settlement type="village">LEUTESDCRF</settlement></placeName> Woods for three(3) or four (4) weeks. During this time he made and lived in two huts (2), located</p>
         <pb n="4" /><label n="264"></label><label><stamp>ITS 027</stamp></label>
         <p>as shown on Exhibit "O" at points B and C. In the month of October 1944, the forester<persName>WALSDORF</persName>found this airmen at point C. took him to a farm (Point D), where he talked to two <placeName><country type="nation">French</country></placeName> POWs and ate a meal. (Exhibits "P" end ""). From one POW a description of the <!--airmen--> was obtained : Forty (40) years to forty-five years old, radio operator from a four (4) motored Bomber with a crew of mostly negros, height about one (I) meter and seventy-five (75) cm, heavily built, about eighty (80) kgs, black heir, dark skin, small eyes, married to an Americen nurse stationed in Paris and had two children.</p>
         <p>From point D the airmen was taken to the Burgermeister's OFFICE in <placeName><settlement type="village">LEUTESDORF</settlement></placeName>, registered (Records have since been lost), And evacuated at <placeName><settlement type="town">Neuwied</settlement></placeName>. One or two days later, the prisoner was returned to LEUTESDORF, in the company of a member of the GESTAPO named <persName>EICH</persName> (<persName>EICH</persName> wes killed toward the end of the war by German soldiers,) and a member of the <placeName><country type="nation">French</country></placeName> Legion. From the Burgermeister's Office they proceeded to <placeName><settlement type="village">HUBERTUSHOF</settlement></placeName> with <persName>GROMIG</persName>. At <placeName><settlement type="village">HUBERTUSHOF</settlement></placeName> the Forester wes not there to show the way into the woods, so a boy named <persName>SCHUTZ</persName> proceeded to direct the group, which by this time had increased in number to five (5). From HUBEKRTUSHOF they followed the route indicated by a red pencil on the sketch Exhibit "I".</p>
         <p>From this point on there are several stories, but this is what the undersigned believed happened:</p>
         <p>The group of five (5) proceeded to a point in the woods, indicated at Point E, where Mr. <persName>GROMIG</persName> told the boy <persName>SCHUTZ</persName> to return. The boy departed in the direction indicated by a blue pencil and returned to <placeName><settlement type="village">LEUTESDORF</settlement></placeName>. For the first 100 hundred yards after the boy departed, he looked back and watched the remaining four (4) enter the woods at Point F. Information as to what happened from there on is very vague. It is further believed, however, <persName>GROMIG</persName>, <persName>EICH</persName>, the <placeName><country type="nation">French</country></placeName> Legionnaire and the airmen proceeded into the woods and the airmen shot at a point unknown. Since <persName>EICH</persName> is dead, the <placeName><country type="nation">French</country></placeName> Legionnaire is Unknown and <persName>GROMIG</persName> will not talk, it is very difficult to locate the place of murder. The party without the <!--airman--> returned to <placeName><settlement type="village">LEUTESDORF</settlement></placeName>, where various converstions</p>
         <pb n="5" /><label n="265"></label><label><stamp>ITS 028</stamp></label>
         <p>were held and remarks made. The LEUTESDORF woods have been thoroughly searched along the routes followed and at Points B,E,F and C with negative results as to locating the grave. It is believed at this time as every possible clue has been followed up and no further information is available.</p>
         <p>Another grave referred to in the basic communication was reported by Mr. <persName>SCHNEIDER</persName>. While walking in the woods one day with his two boys in May 1944, <persName>SCHNEIDER</persName> found a body.(Exhibits "G" and "M”). The <!--undersigned--> took Mr.<persName>SCHNEIDER</persName> into the woods to have him point out the spot where he had seen the body, indicated on the sketch at Point A. After searching the ground in the vicinity of Point A, a soft spot was found and the remains of a body were discovered. The deceased was clothed, as Mr. <persName>SCHNEIDER</persName> stated, as follows: Civilian Clothes and parts of a <placeName><country type="nation">French</country></placeName> uniform, <placeName><country type="nation">French</country></placeName> shoes, <placeName><country type="nation">French</country></placeName> aspirin tube in the pocket. The head was in several pieces end a piece of denture was found, part of a plate from a full set of false teeth. Printed on the rubber part of the plate was MEUNIER BURDIN PATENT NO. 00. From all appearances the remains are not <placeName><country type="nation">American</country></placeName> or English, but are <placeName><country type="nation">French</country></placeName>.</p>
         <p>In Exhibit “C" the statement <persName>GLUSING</persName> made, according to <persName>LINZ</persName>, was "keep mum about this, it was not only one (I) but three (3), they were spies", is a false statement made by <persName>LINZ</persName> to implicate more people. Another Letter from <persName>LINZ</persName> mentioned in basic communication refers to a wounded pilot. All of the information <persName>LINZ</persName> has written is second or third hand and exaggerated. The wounded pilot was taken to a hospital and has been returned to the Z.I. His name was <persName>SMITH Paul E.</persName>, PFC. 13155431, reported on MARC #K-503. Exhibit "R". Two (2) other remains referred to by Mr. <persName>LINZ</persName> have been disinterred and reburied in <placeName><settlement type="town">HAMM</settlement></placeName>, Military Cemetery. They are: <persName>CHINCHILLA, FRANCIS P.</persName> and <persName>HOLLENBECK, CHARLES E.</persName>(Exhibit "R") who were murdered and buried in <placeName><settlement type="village">WOLLENDORF</settlement></placeName>. Since disinterment, persons concerned with the atrocity have been tried and punished.</p>

         <p>With reference to letter from Office of Military Government, Liaison and Security
            Office, SK, LK, <placeName><settlement type="town">Offenbach</settlement></placeName> <placeName><region>(Hessen)</region></placeName> APO 633, US.Army, signed by <persName>Arthur SHANLY</persName>, 1st LT., Mr. <persName>LINZ</persName> is not working for the <placeName><country type="nation">French</country></placeName> Military Government. The reason the <placeName><country type="nation">French</country></placeName> told him to keep quiet is because <persName>LINZ</persName> has been living in this vicinity which has been about all his life. He has been arrested fourteen (14) times for stirring up trouble. Mr. <persName>LINZ</persName> can only refer to other people as he has no first hand information.It has been rumored by <persName>LINZ</persName> that Frau <persName>ZEUS</persName> gave the <placeName><country type="nation">French</country></placeName> wine to have Mr. <persName>ZEUS</persName> released from jail. This rumor is also false. The <placeName><country type="nation">French</country></placeName> buy wine from all the wine merchants in the <placeName><country type="nation">French</country></placeName> Zone. The <placeName><country type="nation">French</country></placeName> War Crimes Commission in <placeName><settlement type="city">KOBLENZ</settlement></placeName> and the <placeName><country type="nation">French</country></placeName> Military Government in <placeName><settlement type="town">KOBLENZ</settlement></placeName> and <placeName><settlement type="town">NEUWIED</settlement></placeName> have been working in conjunction with the <!--undersigned--> and have been of great help and assistance.</p>
         <!--CONCLUSION : -->
         <p>That all the deceased mentioned in the Basic Communications (Germany K-5I) 9786 and 9808 have been recovered except of one (I) unknown airmen, murdered in the LEUTESDORF FOREST.All possible efforts have been exhausted with negative results as to the location of an
