            <p>An "on the spot" investigation of <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#place002">LEUTESDORF FOREST</a> revealed the wreckage of a B-I7 SN.43-38189, nicknamed "Powerful Katinka." Missing
                Air Crew Heport #K-484 shows nine (9) members of the crew in plane at the time of
                crash, four (4) returned to Military Control, five (5) on a PDD Status. Inclosed for
                reference are two Missing Air Crew Reports (#K-484 Exhibit "A" and #R-348 Exhibit
                "B").</p>
            
            <p><a href="./Standoff.xhtml#person001">DRUGAN, DONALD T.</a>, 2nd It., 0-768485. Burial Report shows <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#person001">Lt. DHUGAN</a> as being disinterred with two (2) I.D. tags from <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#place003">BEROD</a> (K-5L/wP-9727), <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#place001">Germany</a> end coming from plane, identified by two machine gun numbers 647650 and 647764 (MACR
                # H-348), of which <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#person001">Lt. DRUGAN</a> was not a member. This B-IT7 SN. 42-31582 is believed to have crashed in the vicinity
                of <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#place003">BEROD</a>, <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#place001">Germany</a>.</p>
            
            <p><a href="./Standoff.xhtml#person002">MOHN, JONATHAN V.</a>, 2nd Lt., 0-775481. Burial Report shows <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#person002">Lt. MOHN</a> disinterred from <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#place002">LEUTESDORF FOREST</a> (K-51/F-7506), <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#place001">Germany</a> as a surface burial, identified by two (2)I.D. tags. No. K-484 <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#person002">Lt. MOHN</a> is listed as Co-pilot.</p>
            
            
            <p><a href="./Standoff.xhtml#person003">WASSERMANN, GERALD M.</a>, 2nd Lt., 0-2060421. As far as records show <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#person003">Lt. WASSEHMANN</a> is not re-interred as a known. (See Exhibit "C"). Forester <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#person012">WALSDORF </a>located the remains of <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#person003">WASSERMANN</a> (NARRATIVE on Investigation of Cases in the <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#place002">LEUTESDORF FOREST</a>, dtd. 26 November 1947, cont'd.)</p>         
            
            
            
            <p>and removed the I.D. tag. The remains were interred in <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#place004">Leutesdorf</a> Cemetery and since disinterred by an unknown American Unit. Mr. <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#person012">WALSDORF</a> gave the I.D. tag to the Undersigned. All the people that had anything to do with
                handling the remains were questioned in an attempt to definitely establish the grave
                <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#person003">WASSERMANN</a> was buried in <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#place004">Leutesdorf</a> Cemetery so final identification could be made, but nothing could be obtained.</p>
            
            <p><a href="./Standoff.xhtml#person004">PARKER, JURL T.</a>, Sgt. 38469636. Records of this Headquarters show <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#person004">Sgt. PARKER</a>disinterred as Unknown X-2278, later identified. X-2278 was disinterred from <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#place003">BEROD</a>,(K-5I/xF-9727), <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#place001">Germany</a>. On the back of the burial report <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#person004">Sgt. PARKER</a> came from the B-I7 with machine gun numbers 647650 and 647764 which is not the plane
                <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#person004">Sgt. PARKER</a> was in</p>
            
            <p><a href="./Standoff.xhtml#person005">STEVENS, ROBERT</a>, Sgt., 39719976. There is no record of Sgt.<a href="./Standoff.xhtml#person004">Stevens</a> being re-interred as a known. Forester <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#person012">WALSDORF</a> was present at the time the remains were located and interred in <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#place004">LEUTESDORF</a> Cemetery and since disinterred by an unknown American Unit. (Exhibit "D").From the
                above information it appears the remains from the two planes were mixed up after disinterment.
                A total of fifteen (15) remains were disinterred from <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#place004">LEUTESDORF</a> Cemetery and adjacent woods, fourteen (14) from the cemetery and one (I) from the
                woods <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#person001">(Lt. MOHN)</a>. Of the fifteen (15) deceased five (5) described above were from B-I7 reported on
                MACR #K-484, and ten (10) were from B-I7 reported on MACR #V-43. (Exhibit “E”).</p>

            <p>With reference to Basic Communications, Case Numbers (Germany K-5I) 9786 and 9808,
                pertaining to several American graves in the <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#place002">FOREST OF LEUTESDORF</a>, negative results were obtained. Mr. <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#person020">KROHN</a> was contacted and his information came from several other people, primarily Mr. <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#person009">LINZ</a> and Mr. <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#person021">ULMERSBACH</a>.</p>
            
            
            <p>Mr. <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#person009">LINZ</a> was contacted with reference to inclosures signed by SS Troops, he has a very revengeful
                attitude and has the tendency to exaggerate. Mr. <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#person021">ULMERSBACH</a> was also contacted end his attitude is much the same as Mr. <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#person009">LINZ</a>, because the Americans upon taking <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#place004">Leutesdorf</a> put him in as Burgermeister, later the German people through the French had him thrown
                out. The French War Crimes Commission at <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#place005">KOBLENZ</a> worked with the undersigned and carried out an investigation of their own, resulting
                in Mr. <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#person011">GROMIG's</a> arrest and eventual trial. Inclosed as Exhibit "F" is the capy of the French investigation.</p>
            
            <p>The undersigned obtained statements from the following people:</p>
            
            
            <p> Exhibit "G" Statement of Mr. <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#person009">LINZ</a></p>
            
            <p>  Exhibit "H" Statement of the boy <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#person010">SCHUTZ</a> who originally was too young to legally sign his name, but signed the statement later
                upon the request of the undersigned.</p>
            
            <p> Exhibit "I" and “J" Statement of Nr. <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#person011">GROMIG</a></p>
            
            <p> &gt;Exhibit "K" Statement of Mr. <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#person012">WALSDORF</a></p>
            
            <p> Exhibit "L" Statement of Mr. <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#person013">GLUSING</a></p>
            
            
            <p>Included in the French Investigation("Exhibit "F") are statements from Mr. <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#person013">GLUSING</a>, Mrs. <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#person015">ZUES</a>, Mis <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#person024">BARKLAGE</a>, Mr. <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#person011">GROMIG</a>, Mr. <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#person015">ZUES</a>, Mr. <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#person017">WIMBRSBACH</a>, Mr. <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#person009">LINZ</a> and Mr. <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#person012">WALSDORF</a>. Additional information was obtained from Mr. <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#person018">SCHNEIDER</a> (Exhibit "M") and Mr. <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#person013">GLUSING</a> (Exhibit "N"). A sketch is attached as exhibit "O". Following is a summary of the
                information obtained: A four (4) motored Bomber supposedly crashed in the vicinity
                of <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#place004">Leutesdorf</a>. Several planes crashed in this area and have been located, identified and crews
                accounted for. The Bomber in question can not be located, identified, or any members
                of its crew identified. At the time of the crash which took place about September
                or October 1944, one (I) crew-member lived in the <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#place002">LEUTESDORF</a> Woods for three(3) or four (4) weeks. During this time he made and lived in two huts
                (2), located</p>
            
            
            <p>as shown on Exhibit "O" at points B and C. In the month of October 1944, the forester<a href="./Standoff.xhtml#person012">WALSDORF</a>found this airmen at point C. took him to a farm (Point D), where he talked to two
                French POWs and ate a meal. (Exhibits "P" end ""). From one POW a description of the
                airmen was obtained : Forty (40) years to forty-five years old, radio operator from
                a four (4) motored Bomber with a crew of mostly negros, height about one (I) meter
                and seventy-five (75) cm, heavily built, about eighty (80) kgs, black heir, dark skin,
                small eyes, married to an Americen nurse stationed in <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#place006">Paris</a> and had two children.</p>
            
            <p>From point D the airmen was taken to the Burgermeister's OFFICE in <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#place004">Leutesdorf</a>, registered (Records have since been lost), And evacuated at <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#place007">Neuwied</a>. One or two days later, the prisoner was returned to LEUTESDORF, in the company of
                a member of the GESTAPO named <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#person019">EICH</a> (<a href="./Standoff.xhtml#person019">EICH</a> wes killed toward the end of the war by German soldiers,) and a member of the French
                Legion. From the Burgermeister's Office they proceeded to <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#place008">HUBERTUSHOF</a> with <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#person011">GROMIG</a>. At <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#place008">HUBERTUSHOF</a> the Forester wes not there to show the way into the woods, so a boy named <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#person010">SCHUTZ</a> proceeded to direct the group, which by this time had increased in number to five
                (5). From <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#place008">HUBERTUSHOF</a> they followed the route indicated by a red pencil on the sketch Exhibit "I".</p>
            
            <p>From this point on there are several stories, but this is what the undersigned believed
                happened:</p>
            
            <p>The group of five (5) proceeded to a point in the woods, indicated at Point E, where
                Mr. <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#person011">GROMIG</a> told the boy <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#person010">SCHUTZ</a> to return. The boy departed in the direction indicated by a blue pencil and returned
                to <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#place004">Leutesdorf</a>. For the first 100 hundred yards after the boy departed, he looked back and watched
                the remaining four (4) enter the woods at Point F. Information as to what happened
                from there on is very vague. It is further believed, however, <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#person011">GROMIG</a>, <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#person019">EICH</a>, the French Legionnaire and the airmen proceeded into the woods and the airmen shot
                at a point unknown. Since <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#person019">EICH</a> is dead, the French Legionnaire is Unknown and <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#person011">GROMIG</a> will not talk, it is very difficult to locate the place of murder. The party without
                the airman returned to <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#place004">Leutesdorf</a>, where various converstions</p>
            
            
            <p>were held and remarks made. The LEUTESDORF woods have been thoroughly searched along
                the routes followed and at Points B,E,F and C with negative results as to locating
                the grave. It is believed at this time as every possible clue has been followed up
                and no further information is available.</p>
            
            <p>Another grave referred to in the basic communication was reported by Mr. <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#person018">SCHNEIDER</a>. While walking in the woods one day with his two boys in May 1944, <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#person018">SCHNEIDER</a> found a body.(Exhibits "G" and "M”). The undersigned took Mr.<a href="./Standoff.xhtml#person018">SCHNEIDER</a> into the woods to have him point out the spot where he had seen the body, indicated
                on the sketch at Point A. After searching the ground in the vicinity of Point A, a
                soft spot was found and the remains of a body were discovered. The deceased was clothed,
                as Mr. <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#person018">SCHNEIDER</a> stated, as follows: Civilian Clothes and parts of a French uniform, French shoes,
                French aspirin tube in the pocket. The head was in several pieces end a piece of denture
                was found, part of a plate from a full set of false teeth. Printed on the rubber part
                of the plate was MEUNIER BURDIN PATENT NO. 00. From all appearances the remains are
                not American or English, but are French.</p>
            
            <p>In Exhibit “C" the statement <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#person013">GLUSING</a> made, according to <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#person009">LINZ</a>, was "keep mum about this, it was not only one (I) but three (3), they were spies",
                is a false statement made by <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#person009">LINZ</a> to implicate more people. Another Letter from <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#person009">LINZ</a> mentioned in basic communication refers to a wounded pilot. All of the information
                <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#person009">LINZ</a> has written is second or third hand and exaggerated. The wounded pilot was taken
                to a hospital and has been returned to the Z.I. His name was <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#person022">SMITH Paul E.</a>, PFC. 13155431, reported on MARC #K-503. Exhibit "R". Two (2) other remains referred
                to by Mr. <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#person009">LINZ</a> have been disinterred and reburied in <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#place009">HAMM</a>, Military Cemetery. They are: <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#person006">CHINCHILLA, FRANCIS P.</a> and <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#person007">HOLLENBECK, CHARLES E.</a>(Exhibit "R") who were murdered and buried in <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#place010">WOLLENDORF</a>. Since disinterment, persons concerned with the atrocity have been tried and punished.</p>
            
            
            <p>With reference to letter from Office of Military Government, Liaison and Security
                Office, SK, LK, <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#place011">Offenbach</a> <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#place012">(Hessen)</a> APO 633, US.Army, signed by <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#person023">Arthur SHANLY</a>, 1st LT., Mr. <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#person009">LINZ</a> is not working for the French Military Government. The reason the French told him
                to keep quiet is because <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#person009">LINZ</a> has been living in this vicinity which has been about all his life. He has been arrested
                fourteen (14) times for stirring up trouble. Mr. <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#person009">LINZ</a> can only refer to other people as he has no first hand information.It has been rumored
                by <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#person009">LINZ</a> that Frau <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#person015">ZUES</a> gave the French wine to have Mr. <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#person014">ZUES</a> released from jail. This rumor is also false. The French buy wine from all the wine
                merchants in the French Zone. The French War Crimes Commission in <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#place005">KOBLENZ</a> and the French Military Government in <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#place005">KOBLENZ</a> and <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#place007">NEUWIED</a> have been working in conjunction with the undersigned and have been of great help
                and assistance.</p>
            
            <p>CONCLUSION : </p>
            
            <p>That all the deceased mentioned in the Basic Communications (Germany K-5I) 9786 and
                9808 have been recovered except of one (I) unknown airmen, murdered in the LEUTESDORF
                FOREST.All possible efforts have been exhausted with negative results as to the location
                of an
                American grave.</p>
